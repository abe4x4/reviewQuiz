After trying many different ideas and deciding on what technology to use and from where to get the data for my project. I decided to do a quiz app using react.js and getting trivia data from a trivia API at https://opentdb.com/. I followed these steps:

1. initialized git in the project folder and set up gitignore
3. installed node.js and npm and initialized npm (npm init)
4. Used create-react-app to create my react project
5. used 'npm start' to start the development server
6. Ifirst used hard coded data saved in a file 'data.js' that I deleted later when I was able to extract quiz data from the free trivia API
7. the project is functional and the extracted data from the API is formated properly to be suitable for the project
8. The project is responsive and visually acceptable
9. I am planing to work more on the project as a later time  to add more funcionality and give it more options like: 
    a. Adding a user registration form
    b. giving the user the option to choose the quiz topic
    c. Adding a flashcard option
    
The features that the project has to meet the passing requierments:
1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in the app
2. Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in the app.
3. Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.  
4. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
5. Develop project using React.

I admit that I still have a long way to go to learn modern javascript and React.js but for sure I was finally able to understand the language and its logic thanks to Code Louisville and to the knowlegeable and very helpfule mentors
